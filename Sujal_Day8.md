Day 8: In-depth Study of Complex Data Structures

1.**Lists**
Definition: Lists are ordered collections that can store elements of various types. They are mutable, meaning they can be modified after creation.
Operations:
Indexing: Accessing elements by position.
Slicing: Extracting parts of the list.
Methods: append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), clear(), sort(), reverse().
 
2. **Sets**
Definition: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are mutable, but their elements must be immutable.
Operations:
Set operations: union(), intersection(), difference(), symmetric_difference().
Methods: add(), remove(), discard(), pop(), clear().
 
3. **Dictionaries**
Definition: Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable, while values can be any data type.
Operations:
Accessing values by key, updating, and deleting key-value pairs.
Methods: get(), keys(), values(), items(), pop(), clear().
 
4. **Tuples**
Definition: Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences. They can store elements of different types and are often used to group related data.
Operations:
Indexing, slicing, and unpacking.
Methods: count(), index().
