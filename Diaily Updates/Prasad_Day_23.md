#  Strategies for transformations and animations in Manim

1. Break down complex animations into smaller parts: Instead of trying to create a complex animation in one step, break it
   down into smaller, more manageable parts. This will make it easier to understand and debug your animation.

2. Use transition states: Identify the key transition states of an object, such as changes in opacity, scale, or rotation.
   By defining these states, you can create a smooth and cohesive animation.

3. Utilize animation methods: Manim provides various animation methods, such as Create, FadeIn, FadeOut, Scale, Rotate, and
   MoveTo. Use these methods to create animations that are easy to understand and maintain.

4. Leverage the power of updaters: Updaters are functions that update the animation over time. Use updaters to create custom
   animations that are not possible with built-in animation methods.

5. Use rate functions to control animation speed: Rate functions allow you to control the speed of an animation over time.
     Use rate functions to create animations that accelerate, decelerate, or follow a specific curve.

6. Experiment with different animation durations: The duration of an animation can greatly affect its overall impact.
     Experiment with different durations to find the one that works best for your animation.

7. Use animation chaining: Animation chaining allows you to create complex animations by chaining together multiple
    animations. Use animation chaining to create animations that are easy to understand and maintain.

8. Utilize the wait method: The wait method allows you to pause the animation for a specified amount of time.
    Use the wait method to create animations that have a natural pause or delay.
