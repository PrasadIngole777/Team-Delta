Debugging allows developers to:

	- Ensure that their code is working as expected

	- Improve the overall quality of their software

	- Save time and resources by catching and fixing errors early on
	
	- Enhance their problem-solving and critical thinking skills


Debugging in Different Programming Language :
	Debugging strategies may vary depending on the programming language.

	- In dynamic languages like Python, developers may rely on print statements and interactive debuggers

	- In statically-typed languages like Java/Cpp, developers may use type checking and compile-time error messages


Tools for Effective Debugging :
	
	- Python Debugger (pdb)

	- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

	- Version Control Systems
