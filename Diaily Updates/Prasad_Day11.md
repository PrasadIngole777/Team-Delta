Syntax of Objects and Classes in Python
   
    A class is a blueprint for creating objects in Python
    To create a class, use the class keyword followed by the name of the class
    The body of the class contains methods and properties that define the behavior and state of the class

Example : 

    class MyClass:
        """This is a simple class example"""
        my_property = 0

    def my_method(self):
        """This is a simple method"""
        pass

      To create an object from a class, use the classname() syntax
      my_object = MyClass()
