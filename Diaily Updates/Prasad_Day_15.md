Numpy : Numerical Python

    --> Data in Numerical Python is arranged in a homogeneous manner, meaning that all elements of a data structure 
        are of the same type.
        
    --> Contiguous memory allows for efficient access and manipulation of data, as all elements are stored in a 
        continuous block of memory.
        
    --> Numerical Python provides tools for efficient data manipulation and computation.
    
    --> This includes various methods for slicing, indexing, and manipulating data, as well as optimized functions 
        for mathematical operations.

Library Advantages : 

    --> Linear algebra and mathematical functions
    
    --> Plotting and data visualization
    
    --> Interfacing with other languages and libraries

Structured Arrays and Heterogeneous Data in Numerical Python : 

      --> In addition to homogeneous arrays, Numerical Python also supports structured arrays for handling 
          heterogeneous data.
          
      --> Structured arrays allow for the storage of different data types in a single array, with each element 
          being a fixed-size record of multiple fields.
